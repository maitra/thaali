Description:
Thaali is a fork of the apparently defunct pekSysTray. Both of them are system trays "notification area" dockapp similar to the GNOME
notification area applet. But it's designed for any window manager supporting 
docking. It created blocks that contains the icons, when a block is full (no 
more space for other icons) a new block is created. The call to invoke thaali is the same as that of peksystray.

Requirements:
X, gcc.

Installation:
make
make install

Running:
thaali --help ;-)

Example:
* To have horizontal lines of four icons of 16x16 (the default):
thaali
* For WindowMaker, blocks of 64x64 containing 4 icons:
thaali --border 2 --icon-size 30 --width 64 --height 64
* To have one new window per icon:
thaali --icon-size 48 --width 48 --height 48
